# Project information
A local Library wants to introduce a new system to improve its book management. The library relied on paper records and the librarian’s memory, which had an extremely low tolerance for human error. With the new system, the administration wants to keep all the records on the online system and assist the librarian in their daily work. 

# Project requirement
Create the item register for each of the items in the system 

Administer of the system can Add items to the system

Could adding a brand new item

Could adding an existing item to the system (will increase quantities of that item)

Administer of the system can Modify items details to the system

Could remove items from the system

Could modify the quantities of the items 

Could you modify the description & name of the times 

Administer of the system can keep tracking the status of each item in the system

Could view the items & records 

The system would generate a record once the items’ status changed. The record should contain the information of the item's details and the date of the record to be generated.

Should provide UI for administers to interact with the items

Login system for the administer (A new administer gains his/her account under permission) 

Basic Authentication & Access control to the system.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
